# BendingSpoons

This is a code example for Bending Spoons. This was written during data analysis of a human study. This function is stand alone, however I cannot share an example data file due to legal constraints. Each data file contained participant results for each of three 'treatments'.  These were then compared with an anova analysis, a tukey analysis, and some simple data analysis (that was used mostly for graphic purposes).
